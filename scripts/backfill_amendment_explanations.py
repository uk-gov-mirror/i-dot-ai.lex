Backfill AI explanations for amendments missing them, then re-embed.

Two-phase pipeline:
  Phase 1: Generate GPT-5-nano explanations and update Qdrant payloads (legislation.gov.uk bound)
  Phase 2: Re-embed all amendments that have explanations (embedding API bound)

Usage:
    # Dry run (preview counts, no changes)
    USE_CLOUD_QDRANT=true uv run python scripts/backfill_amendment_explanations.py

    # Small test
    USE_CLOUD_QDRANT=true uv run python scripts/backfill_amendment_explanations.py --apply --limit 100

    # Full Phase 1 only (generate explanations)
    USE_CLOUD_QDRANT=true uv run python scripts/backfill_amendment_explanations.py --apply --phase 1

    # Full Phase 2 only (re-embed)
    USE_CLOUD_QDRANT=true uv run python scripts/backfill_amendment_explanations.py --apply --phase 2

    # Full run (both phases)
